# Jump
Dino jump game

## Project Description

This project is a React-based implementation of the classic dino jump game. The game logic and rendering are handled using React components and JSX syntax. The game utilizes React's state management, lifecycle methods, hooks, and context API. Power-ups such as speed boosts, invincibility, and double points are included, along with visual and sound effects to indicate when a power-up is collected and active.
